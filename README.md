# Team H - Aircraft Routing Optimization

A project for optimizing aircraft routing problems using advanced algorithms including Christofides and Chained Lin-Kernighan heuristics.

## Team Members
- Logan Markley

## Project Overview
This project focuses on solving aircraft routing optimization problems using algorithmic approaches. It consists of:

- A **frontend** built with Next.js that provides a user interface for visualization and interaction
- A **backend** written in Python that implements the Christofides algorithm with Chained Lin-Kernighan optimization

## Getting Started

### Backend
Navigate to the `backend-directory` folder and follow the instructions in its README to set up the Python environment and run the optimization algorithms.

### Frontend
Navigate to the `frontend-directory` folder and follow the instructions in its README to set up the Next.js development environment and interact with the application.

## Project Structure
- `/backend-directory` - Contains the core optimization algorithms and problem generators
- `/frontend-directory` - Contains the web interface for interacting with the optimization engine
